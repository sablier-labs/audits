- [EIP-165 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)

## Summary

The `SablierFlowBase` contract does not adhere to the `EIP4906` standard, as it fails to implement the required
`supportsInterface(bytes4)` function to confirm compatibility with the `IERC4906` interface. This omission can cause
integration issues for contracts that rely on `EIP-165` to verify interface support.

## Vulnerability Details:

The `ISablierFlowBase` interface inherits from `IERC4906`, but the `SablierFlowBase` contract does not override the
`supportsInterface()` function.

```solidity

  interface ISablierFlowBase is
      IERC4906, // 2 inherited components
      IERC721Metadata, // 2 inherited components
      IAdminable // 0 inherited components

```

## Impact Details

The lack of a proper `supportsInterface` implementation can cause significant compatibility issues. Systems that check
for `EIP-165` compliance may fail to interact correctly with the `SablierFlowBase` contract. This could lead to failures
in contract interactions, integrations, and potentially disrupt decentralized applications relying on `SablierFlowBase`.

## POC:

Add the following test file to the test folder:

`tests\Chista0xAudit.t.sol`

```solidity

        assertEq(res, true, "EIP165 interface not supported");
    }

    function test_supportsInterface_IERC721() external view {

        assertEq(res, true, "IERC4906 interface not supported");
    }

```

Run the test with the command `forge test --mc Chista0xAudit`

## <a id='L-02'></a>L-02. It is possible to avoid paying the `protocolFee`

## Summary

It is possible to avoid paying the `protocolFee`Â via withdrawing small amounts of tokens. Although gas fees for
transactions would deter users from withdrawing small amounts, considering that the Sablier protocol is supporting any
ERC20 token that has less than 19 decimals, this becomes a valid attack vector for tokens with little decimals.

## Vulnerability Details

Sablier admin can implement protocol fees for a token with the `setProtocolFee` function found in the
`SablierFlowBase.sol` contract.

```Solidity
    function setProtocolFee(IERC20 token, UD60x18 newProtocolFee) external override onlyAdmin {
        // Check: the new protocol fee is not greater than the maximum allowed.
        if (newProtocolFee > MAX_FEE) {
            revert Errors.SablierFlowBase_ProtocolFeeTooHigh(newProtocolFee, MAX_FEE);
        }

        UD60x18 oldProtocolFee = protocolFee[token];

        // Effects: set the new protocol fee.
        protocolFee[token] = newProtocolFee;

        // Log the change of the protocol fee.
        emit ISablierFlowBase.SetProtocolFee({
            admin: msg.sender,
            token: token,
            oldProtocolFee: oldProtocolFee,
            newProtocolFee: newProtocolFee
        });

        // Refresh the NFT metadata for all streams.
        emit BatchMetadataUpdate({ _fromTokenId: 1, _toTokenId: nextStreamId - 1 });
    }
```

This `protocolFee` is applied when a user calls the `withdraw` function which calls the `_withdraw` in the
`SablierFlow.sol` contract.

```Solidity
    function _withdraw(
        uint256 streamId,
        address to,
        uint128 amount
    )
        internal
        returns (uint128 withdrawnAmount, uint128 protocolFeeAmount)
    {
        // rest of the function

        if (protocolFee > ZERO) {
            // Calculate the protocol fee amount and the net withdraw amount.
            (protocolFeeAmount, amount) = Helpers.calculateAmountsFromFee({ totalAmount: amount, fee: protocolFee });

            // Safe to use unchecked because addition cannot overflow.
            unchecked {
                // Effect: update the protocol revenue.
                protocolRevenue[token] += protocolFeeAmount;
            }
        }

        unchecked {
            // Effect: update the aggregate balance.
            aggregateBalance[token] -= amount;
        }

        // Interaction: perform the ERC-20 transfer.
        token.safeTransfer({ to: to, value: amount });

        // rest of the function
    }
```

As seen from this function, the protocolFee that will be applied is calculated in the `calculateAmountsFromFee` function
in the `Helpers.sol` contract.

```Solidity
    function calculateAmountsFromFee(
        uint128 totalAmount,
        UD60x18 fee
    )
        internal
        view
        returns (uint128 feeAmount, uint128 netAmount)
    {
        // Calculate the fee amount based on the fee percentage.
        feeAmount = ud(totalAmount).mul(fee).intoUint128();

        // Calculate the net amount after subtracting the fee from the total amount.
        netAmount = totalAmount - feeAmount;
    }
```

Due to the use of [UD60x18 math](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math/blob/main/src/ud60x18/Math.sol), in low
`totalAmount` inputs, the `feeAmount` will return 0. This can be verified by adding the following line in the function.

```Solidity
console.log("fee amount:", feeAmount);
```

This creates an attack vector where users can withdraw small amounts of tokens (e.g. withdraw 9 tokens at a time when
fee is 10%) to avoid paying fees. Tokens with industry standard decimals (decimals >= 6) make this attack vector
unlikely as malicious actors would have to pay a lot of gas fees to avoid paying `protocolFee`. However, as specified in
the Scope of the audit:

> Any ERC-20 token can be used with Flow as long as it adheres to the following assumptions:

> 1. The total supply of any ERC-20 token remains below $(2^{128} - 1)$, i.e., `type(uint128).max`.
> 2. The `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods of any ERC-20 token strictly reduce the sender's balance by the transfer
>    amount and increase the recipient's balance by the same amount. In other words, tokens that charge fees on
>    transfers are not supported.
> 3. An address' ERC-20 balance can only change as a result of a `transfer` call by the sender or a `transferFrom` call
>    by an approved address. This excludes rebase tokens, interest-bearing tokens, and permissioned tokens where the
>    admin can arbitrarily change balances.
> 4. The token contract does not allow callbacks (e.g., ERC-777 is not supported).

This means that Sablier Flow is expected to support ERC20 tokens with low decimals. Tokens with low decimals make this
attack vector very likely to happen as amount of calls needed to make to withdraw full amount while avoiding fees will
be low. This amount calculated with the following solidity calculation assuming the `protocolFee` is 10%.&#x20;

```Solidity
uint256 calls = ((tokenAmount * (10 ** decimals) / 9)) + ((tokenAmount * (10 ** decimals)) % 9 > 0 ? 1 : 0);
```

This calculation can also be written as the following math equation once again assuming theÂ `protocolFee` is 10%, where
`N` is the amount of calls required, `T` is the amount of tokens and `d` is the amount of decimals.

$N = \lfloor\lfloor T \times 10^d\rfloor \div 9\rfloor + \min(1, (T \times 10^d) \bmod 9)$

As an example, using this calculation, we can find out that in order to withdraw 10 tokens with 0 decimals it would take
2 different calls to withdraw the full amount while avoiding fees, for 10 tokens and 2 decimals 112 different calls.
Making tokens with low decimals very susceptible to this attack as it would be profitable for malicious actors to split
their withdraw in multiple calls to avoid paying the `protocolFee` and pay less of that amount in gas fees.Â \
Consider that as the `protocolFee` goes down, amount of tokens that can be withdraw in a single transaction goes up making
the attack cost less gas to perform. Even if no tokens with low decimals become widely used, this attack can very well be
worth to execute if gas prices keep going down and BTC (widely used token with most value for 1 wei) price goes up.

## Proof of Concept

Add the following test contract in the tests file and run it to observe the vulnerability. In order to run this test,
add a `mint` function in the `MockERC20.sol`

```Solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;

import { Test } from "forge-std/src/Test.sol";
import { console } from "forge-std/src/console.sol";
import "../src/SablierFlow.sol";
import "../src/interfaces/IFlowNFTDescriptor.sol";
import "./mocks/ERC20Mock.sol";

// Mock NFT descriptor to satisfy constructor requirements
contract MockNFTDescriptor is IFlowNFTDescriptor {
    function tokenURI(IERC721Metadata, uint256) external pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "test_uri";
    }
}

contract CustomTest is Test {
    SablierFlow private flow;
    ERC20Mock private token;
    ERC20Mock private wbtc;
    MockNFTDescriptor private nftDescriptor;

    address private sender = address(0x1);
    address private recipient = address(0x2);
    address private admin = address(0x3);
    uint128 private amount = 100e18;
    uint256 private streamId;

function setUp() public {
    // Deploy mock tokens and NFT descriptor
    token = new ERC20Mock("MockToken", "MTK", 0);
    wbtc = new ERC20Mock("Wrapped Bitcoin", "WBTC", 8);
    nftDescriptor = new MockNFTDescriptor();

    // Mint initial tokens directly to the sender's address
    token.mint(sender, amount);
    wbtc.mint(sender, amount);

    // Deploy the SablierFlow contract
    flow = new SablierFlow(address(admin), nftDescriptor);

    // Approve the SablierFlow contract to spend the sender's tokens
    vm.startPrank(sender);
    token.approve(address(flow), amount);
    wbtc.approve(address(flow), amount);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
 function testCreateAndDepositAndWithdrawWithFee() public {
     // implement the fee
     UD60x18 newFee = UD60x18.wrap(0.1e18);
     vm.prank(admin);
     flow.setProtocolFee(token, newFee);

     // caches
     uint256 decimals = token.decimals();
     uint256 tokenAmount = 10;
     uint128 amountToDeposit = uint128(tokenAmount * (10 ** decimals));

     // create a stream and deposit
     vm.prank(sender);
     streamId = flow.createAndDeposit(sender, recipient, ud21x18(1e18), token, true, amountToDeposit);

     // advance time
     vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10000);

     // calculation
     uint256 calls = ((tokenAmount * (10 ** decimals) / 9)) + ((tokenAmount * (10 ** decimals)) % 9 > 0 ? 1 : 0);
     uint128 withdrawableAmount = flow.withdrawableAmountOf(streamId);

     // recipent withdraw
     vm.startPrank(recipient);
     flow.withdraw(streamId, recipient, 9);
     flow.withdraw(streamId, recipient, 1);
     vm.stopPrank();

     // assertions
     assertEq(calls, 2);
     assertEq(flow.protocolRevenue(token), 0);
     assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(recipient)), withdrawableAmount);
    }
```

## Impact

Likelihood: Low as tokens with such little decimals are not widely used at the moment\
Impact: High as this vulnerability leads to direct loss of funds for the protocol

## Tools Used

Manual review, foundry

## Recommendations

Implement a standard base fee of 1 when `protocolFee > ZERO` but `protocolFeeAmount returns 0`. An example of this is
shown below.

```Solidity
    function _withdraw(
        uint256 streamId,
        address to,
        uint128 amount
    )
        internal
        returns (uint128 withdrawnAmount, uint128 protocolFeeAmount)
    {
        // rest of the function

        if (protocolFee > ZERO) {
            // Calculate the protocol fee amount and the net withdraw amount.
            (protocolFeeAmount, amount) = Helpers.calculateAmountsFromFee({ totalAmount: amount, fee: protocolFee });
            if (protocolFeeAmount == 0) protocolFeeAmount = 1;

            // Safe to use unchecked because addition cannot overflow.
            unchecked {
                // Effect: update the protocol revenue.
                protocolRevenue[token] += protocolFeeAmount;
            }
           // rest of the function
        }
```

Alternatively, protocol already reverts when stream's token decimals are greater than 18, protocol must add another
check to make sure that the token decimals can not be too little. The amount can be set according to what protocol deems
is acceptable (such as 4). An example of this recommendation is shown below.

```Solidity
    function _create(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        UD21x18 ratePerSecond,
        IERC20 token,
        bool transferable
    )
        internal
        returns (uint256 streamId)
    {
        // Check: the sender is not the zero address.
        if (sender == address(0)) {
            revert Errors.SablierFlow_SenderZeroAddress();
        }

        uint8 tokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(address(token)).decimals();

        // Check: the token decimals are not greater than 18.
        if (tokenDecimals > 18 || tokenDecimals < 4) {
            revert Errors.SablierFlow_InvalidTokenDecimals(address(token));
        }
       // rest of the function
```

## <a id='L-03'></a>L-03. depletionTimeOf() can return 0 and a timestamp value when balance and debt relation didn't change

_Submitted by [neilalaois](https://profiles.cyfrin.io/u/undefined),
[cheatc0d33](https://profiles.cyfrin.io/u/undefined). Selected submission by:
[neilalaois](https://profiles.cyfrin.io/u/undefined)._

## Summary

The issue is somewhat similar to the issue reported in Cantina's audit report section 3.3.4\* (copied below). It
describes a problem that depletionTimeOf() returns 0 when it should still return the timestamp of when the totalDebt
will **exceed** the balance by one token. But in this case I want to highlight the return difference of when balance is
and is NOT 0.

## Vulnerability Details

Inconsistent returns from
[depletionTimeOf()](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-10-sablier/blob/8a2eac7a916080f2022527408b004578b21c51d0/src/SablierFlow.sol#L57),
depending if balance is 0 or not, even though the time and rate doesn't change. This is because the function first
checks if there is no balance and returns 0. But if stream has balance > 0, then it will only return 0 if the debt is
above balance + 1 MVT (Minimum Value Transferable).

This creates a scenario where if the value is withdrawn at the time when stream `balance` = `totalDebt` the
`depletionTimeOf()` will shift from returning a timestamp slightly into the future to returning 0. This means that the
depletion isn't correctly configured of what it considers the "depletion time" if it is the timestamp of when the total
debt EXCEEDS the balance or when total debt is EQUAL to the balance.

An example of the problem is that the `depletionTimeOf()` returns:

- rps > 0; balance = 1; totalDebt = 1 -> output is a timestamp
- rps > 0; balance = 0; totalDebt = 0 -> output is 0

Even though in both cases the values are equal, one will provide a timestamp and will consider the stream not yet
depleted, while in the other case it is considered depleted.

For a POC example using the project test case please look at "Tools Used" section.

## Impact

Not completely accurate depletionTimeOf() value. Returns 0 if balance is 0, but returns timestamp if balance = totalDebt
(but their return values should match).

## Tools Used

Manual review + foundry tests

The test does this:

- Matches the totalDebt to stream balance using timestamp warp (prints them out for proof)
- Prints out the timestamp of now and the expected depletionTime which differ by 1 second
- Performs a withdrawal to recipient with the amount matching the balance. Post withdraw balance = 0.
- Prints out the timetstamps again, we see that "now" is still the same, but the depletion time is now 0. Even though
  the block timestamp hasn't changed and any rate parameters haven't changed either.

```Solidity
function test_DepletionTimeOf_balance_discrepancy() external givenNotNull givenNotPaused givenBalanceNotZero {
    console.log("Rate per second        : ", flow.getRatePerSecond(defaultStreamId).intoUint128());

    vm.warp({ newTimestamp: block.timestamp + 47_408_000 });

    console.log("total debt (6 decimals): ", flow.totalDebtOf(defaultStreamId));
    console.log("balance (6 decimals)   : ", flow.getBalance(defaultStreamId));

    console.logString("---PRE withdraw---");

    console.log("---now                 : ", block.timestamp);
    console.log("---depletion time      : ", flow.depletionTimeOf(defaultStreamId));

    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.prank(users.recipient);

    console.logString("---Withdrawing amount = stream balance---");
    flow.withdraw(defaultStreamId, users.recipient, flow.getBalance(defaultStreamId));

    console.logString("---POST withdraw---");

    console.log("---now                 : ", block.timestamp);
    console.log("---depletion time      : ", flow.depletionTimeOf(defaultStreamId));
}
```

The script will print out:

```Solidity
Logs:
  Rate per second        :  1000000000000000
  total debt (6 decimals):  50000000000
  balance (6 decimals)   :  50000000000
  ---PRE withdraw---
  ---now                 :  1777740800
  ---depletion time      :  1777740801
  ---Withdrawing amount = stream balance---
  ---POST withdraw---
  ---now                 :  1777740800
  ---depletion time      :  0
```

This discrepancy is very minor edge case, that the function can return two different outputs at the same time without
changing the rates. And that the depletion time doesn't have to be reached for it to be "depleted". Which is a slight
conflict in theÂ depletionTimeOf logic.

## Recommendations

Probably the simplest solution is to simply remove the `if(balance == 0)` case and always follow the same logic path of
totalDebt has to EXCEED the balance. Otherwise alter the further down logic checks to switch to checking when the
totalDebt EQUALS the balance.

## EXTRA NOTES

The @notice comment in ISablierFlow\.sol inaccurately describes the `depletionTimeOf()`

```Solidity
    /// @notice Returns the time at which the total debt exceeds stream balance. If the total debt is less than
    /// or equal to stream balance, it returns 0.
```

It should probably say that `...If the total debt is MORE than...`

Cantina 3.3.4 report (for reference):

3.3.4 depletionTimeOf() returns 0 when still solvent at edge of depletion time&#x20;

Severity: Low Risk

Context: SablierFlow\.sol#L75 &#x20;

Description: The Natspec of the depletionTimeOf() states that it returns 0 when there is uncovered debt.&#x20;

```Solidity
/// @notice Returns the time at which the stream will deplete its balance and start to accumulate uncovered , debt. If

/// there already is uncovered debt, it returns zero.;
```

The solvencyPeriod is also calculated based on when the debt exceeds the balance by 1.&#x20;

```Solidity
if (tokenDecimals == 18) {
    solvencyAmount = (balance - snapshotDebt + 1);
} else {
    uint128 scaleFactor = (10 ** (18 - tokenDecimals)).toUint128();
    solvencyAmount = (balance - snapshotDebt + 1) * scaleFactor;
}
uint256 solvencyPeriod = solvencyAmount / _streams[streamId].ratePerSecond.unwrap();
```

Therfore depletionTimeOf() should not return 0 when the totalDebt == balance, but rather the timestamp at which 1 more
token will be streamed.&#x20;

Recommendation: Change the `depleteiontimeOf()` as follows:&#x20;

```diff
- if (snapshotDebt + _ongoingDebtOf(streamId) >= balance) {
+ if (snapshotDebt + _ongoingDebtOf(streamId) > balance) {
```

## <a id='L-04'></a>L-04. Flow stream cannot be created for tokens that do not implement the `decimals` function

## Summary

Protocol plans to support all possible ERC20 tokens, except for some criteria but will not be able to support tokens
that do not impelement the `decimals` function.

## Vulnerability Details

The protocol plans to work with any ERC20 token based on the information provided in the readme. Expect for those with
the criteria highlighted below.

> Any ERC-20 token can be used with Flow as long as it adheres to the following assumptions:

> 1. The total supply of any ERC-20 token remains below $(2^{128} - 1)$, i.e., `type(uint128).max`.
> 2. The `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods of any ERC-20 token strictly reduce the sender's balance by the transfer
>    amount and increase the recipient's balance by the same amount. In other words, tokens that charge fees on
>    transfers are not supported.
> 3. An address' ERC-20 balance can only change as a result of a `transfer` call by the sender or a `transferFrom` call
>    by an approved address. This excludes rebase tokens, interest-bearing tokens, and permissioned tokens where the
>    admin can arbitrarily change balances.
> 4. The token contract does not allow callbacks (e.g., ERC-777 is not supported).

However, the SablierFlow incorrectly assumes that the token to be streamed by the creator implements a decimal function.
This is because, upon stream creation, an attempt is made to get the token's
[decimals](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-10-sablier/blob/8a2eac7a916080f2022527408b004578b21c51d0/src/SablierFlow.sol#L579-L582)
by calling the `decimals` function.

```solidity
>>>     uint8 tokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(address(token)).decimals();

        // Check: the token decimals are not greater than 18.
        if (tokenDecimals > 18) {
            revert Errors.SablierFlow_InvalidTokenDecimals(address(token));
        }

```

However, not all tokens (including the standard ones) actually implement a decimals function. According to EIP-20
[standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#decimals),

> decimals

> Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. 8, means to divide the token amount by 100000000 to get its user
> representation.

> OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these
> values to be present.

But by querying the decimal function, due to its non-existence in these tokens, the functions will fail causing that
streams for these tokens cannot be created.

## Impact

Flow streams for tokens like
[cloutContracts](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1da4858ad385cc377165a298cc2ce3fce0c5fd31#readContract),
[DigixDAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0b7927c4af23765cb51314a0e0521a9645f0e2a#readContract), etc cannot be created
if desired due to the absence of the decimal function breaking compatibility.

## Tools Used

Manual review.

## Recommendations

Recommend using a tryCatch block to query the decimals. If it fails, hardcode it to 18 for scaling.
